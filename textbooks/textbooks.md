## Textbooks

### Textbook Policy
The library maintains many textbooks on reserve for short-term use in the library. Every attempt is made to have as many textbooks available as possible each semester for our face to face classes; however, for various reasons, we may not be able to acquire certain titles.  Each campus has the ability to purchase textbooks only for their own campus.

### Textbook Selection
The library obtains the list of books for the semester from the bookstore. Once the list is received, textbooks are purchased based on the following:
-	Textbooks that are required for the courses currently being offered
-	Library's current collection
-	Number of sections of a course
-	Current budget for textbooks
-	Popularity

The library does not purchase textbooks for programs or courses that require the students to buy their own books, for example, RADT (Radiologic Technology) and SURG (Surgical Technology).

### Textbook Weeding
Older versions of new textbooks will be moved to the general collection or deleted. The decision of what to do with the older editions will be made by the librarian responsible for that specific subject area or the textbook reserve librarian. Previous editions of textbooks that have been moved to the general collection will be deleted.
