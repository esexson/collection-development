## Selection 

### Selection Criteria
As the librarian’s mission statement states, the library’s goal is to provide support and supplemental materials for the courses offered at the college. The library strives to offer as many viewpoints as possible in an unbiased manner. 
In addition to relevance, accuracy of information, date of the materials, and impartiality also play a large role in the selection of new material.
The following criteria will be used to guide the selection of materials for this collection:
*	Connection to the College's curriculum
*	Validity, currency, and appropriateness of material
*	Quality and variety of format
*	Cost of the item
*	High potential user appeal
*	Depth of the existing collection in the subject of the item

### Textbooks
All current textbooks are part of the Textbook Reserve collection. Special collection development policies and procedures for textbooks can be found under the Textbooks heading on page 7.
Periodicals
In addition to the general selection criteria, the following should be taken into consideration when selecting new periodicals:
*	Is the information the periodical provides available in electronic format?
*	Does the periodical have a direct connection to the curriculum being taught on the campus?
*	If considering a magazine, would the periodical have a high level of readership at your campus?
Requests for periodicals are submitted to the Assistant Director once a year, during the spring semester.

### Databases
Librarians may make requests for new databases to the Library Director and the Library Director will make the final decision. Library Director may arrange for a trial for librarians to determine if the database will be beneficial addition.

### Electronic Hardware & Software
When adding electronic hardware and software (including iPad apps) to the collection, the same general criteria should be considered in addition to the following guidelines:
-	Appropriateness for the library’s current population
-	Usability for the target audience (students, faculty, or both)
-	Hidden costs, such as licensing fees, updates, hardware, software, any additions needed to run the product

All electronic hardware and software should be held to the same quality standards as similar materials in other formats. If electronic hardware or software is being considered, but it will duplicate another material in a different format, the electronic version must add additional value to the collection. 

Requests for new hardware or software should be submitted to the Assistant Director. The Assistant Director will review the request and then, if she feels it is a positive purchase, she will discuss the request with the Library Director. 

#### New Hardware
When adding new hardware to the collection (for example, iPads, Chromebooks, or Smart TVs) only one should be purchased first. This first purchase should be tested and assessed to ensure that the device works the intended way and meets the patrons' needs. If the device works as expected, then more can be purchased. 

#### IT Requests
Any set up or installation required by IT will be the responsibility of the purchasing librarian. If there is not one single purchasing librarian, the Assistant Director will determine who will be responsible for working with IT.

### DVDs
When considering DVDs, always consider licensing costs. Explore streaming options first. Priority is given to materials needed for coursework or faculty use, but we also add recreational materials as funds allow.
The library does not collect individual or separate streaming films. A vendor does not exist to purchase these types of videos and the library does not have a server to host these videos on.

### Gifts and Donations 
Gifts and donations are welcome, but the gifted or donated materials are subject to the same selection criteria as any other new to the collection materials. Once gifted or donated, the materials become property of the library and the library may use the materials as seen fit.
