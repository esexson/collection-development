## Weeding

### Review of the Collection
Weeding is a crucial part of the collection development process. The library does not have an infinite amount of space to keep every single item. Weeding also allows for an up-to-date collection and ensures that the library is providing top quality materials for the students and faculty. The collection will be reviewed periodically by the librarian assigned to the specific subject area. The Librarians and the subject areas they are responsible for can be found here, on the Staff page of the Central Indiana Libraries' website.

### Weeding Criteria
Based on MUSTIE from the CREW manual, the following is criteria for removal from the collection:
-	Physical deterioration including binding or mending
-	Superseded editions
-	Outdated or inaccurate materials
-	Excess duplicate copies
-	Availability of newer materials
-	Low circulation count
-	Little relevancy for the current curriculum

### Textbooks
All current textbooks are part of the Textbook Reserve collection. Special collection development policies and procedures for textbooks can be found under the Textbooks heading on page 7.

### Periodicals
Periodicals, including journals, magazines, and newspapers, will follow the following purging schedule:

**Quarterly/Bimonthly** - 2 years

**Monthly** - 1 year

**Biweekly** - 6 months

**Weekly** - 3/6 months (depending on storage)

**Daily** - 1 week

### Electronic Hardware & Software
Electronic hardware and software follow the same basic weeding criteria as other materials, but it is important to keep the following four guidelines in mind when weeding:
-	Currency (Outdated material in e-book format is just as detrimental to the collection as are outdated physical books)
-	Reliability of the resourceâ€™s information
-	Another source offers more comprehensive coverage

#### Electronic Hardware
Electronic hardware should be weeded after three years. Circulation stats should be checked every year. If there is a low level of circulation, then an effort should be made by the purchasing librarian to assess why the device(s) are not being used and attempt to find a solution. If, after the three years, the device has a high level of usage then the library should consider replacing the device with an updated version.

### Replacement of Materials
Items weeded from the collection should be evaluated for replacement. Materials that are physically damaged or lost are not automatically replaced. Materials that are overdue for 29 days or longer enter lost status. After five months of the item entering lost status, the item will be considered for replacement based on the criteria below.
The following criteria will be considered when determining if an item should be replaced:
-	high demand for the item
-	high level of importance in relation to the subject or collection
-	availability of the replacement
-	a superior format is available (a format that would better meet the needs of students and faculty)
